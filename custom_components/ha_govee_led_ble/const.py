        # mode mirrors the 33 a3 register, and no colour is ever echoed). That evidence is H617A
        # only and says nothing about this model, so the old assumption is kept here rather than
        # silently extended or silently dropped. supports_white_brightness depends on it: the

        # answer 38 to aa 40, but that reply has been positively excluded as an app segment count
        # (an external H7015 reads 30 against 15 segments proven by an exhaustive per-bit sweep), so
        # copying it in would re-assert the very reading we disproved. The 38 is also not capture-
        # backed: the vendor app never issues aa 40 to this model, so it came from a direct firmware
        # register read. See status_reply::unit_count_body. The real number is a question for the
        # H6199 discovery run, which owns that model's wire behaviour.
